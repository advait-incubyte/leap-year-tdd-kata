# TDD Kata: Leap Year
- This is a Vitest-based kata to practice & demonstrate TDD

### KATA Requirements/Acceptance Criteria
1. All years divisible by 400 ARE leap years (so, for example, 2000 was indeed a leap year),
2. All years divisible by 100 but not by 400 are NOT leap years (so, for example, 1700, 1800, and 1900 were NOT leap years, NOR will 2100 be a leap year),
3. All years divisible by 4 but not by 100 ARE leap years (e.g., 2008, 2012, 2016),
4. All years not divisible by 4 are NOT leap years (e.g. 2017, 2018, 2019).

#### Bonus
The Gregorian Calendar is quite accurate, but could be made more accurate by adding an additional rule that eliminates years divisible by 4000 as leap years.
